This package provides data and code to replicate the analyses reported in: Katovich, Erik (2024). Quantifying the Effects of Energy Infrastructure on Bird Populations and Biodiversity, Environmental Science and Technology, Vol. 58(1), pp. 323-332, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c03899.

Code may be found in the Replication_Package folder. The code for this project is a combination of Stata do-files and R scripts, which must be executed in the order defined in the MASTER_DOFILE. This MASTER_DOFILE may also be found in the Replication_Package folder. Users should download all files inside the Replication_Package folder and save them in a folder which is set as the working directory within the MASTER_DOFILE. 

Datasets for this project (raw, intermediate, and analysis) are accessible for viewing and download at the following public Dropbox link: 
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/0wfljcf2a0vpebjs49hag/h?rlkey=4tn86o0pl5ivj3ofbs5dksa86&dl=0

Users should download datasets within this folder as needed (the entire contents are quite large, with land-use files constituting the largest file type) and save them into a folder called Data within the main working directory folder. Only analysis datasets are required to replicate final figures and tables in the paper.
